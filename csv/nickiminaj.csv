Nicki Minaj,Press Conference,Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded,2012-04-02,charlamagne let's shift gears for a minute and talk about new york city i actually get in arguments because people say nicki doesn't rep new york i say what do you mean she shouts it out all of the time  nicki minaj y'all don't want me to rep y'all y'all don't hear when i rep y'all cause y'all be dickriding everybody else  charlamagne she does have a point do you feel you get the proper love from new york  nicki minaj hell fucking no  charlamagne and i never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers you did the dvds you did the mixtapes you came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in new york  nicki minaj i was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking bmw out on jamaica mutherfucking avenue to amadu and hussaine and these niggas fuck you niggas you niggas don't know the fucking half of what i've fucking been through  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne well sir isaac newton said the law of energy is energy is not lost or destroyed it is merely transferred from on party to the next you got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes something negative about you you read it and now you're miserable  nicki minaj absolutely right absolutely  charlemange what you think about the blogs scaff beezy  scaff sb beezy honestly the blogs could just suck my damn cock balls deepthroat gag and choke  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne so miss nicki minaj what do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like lady gaga or madonna and you're doing things for shock value  nicki minaj well i mean i don't know in a minute if i fucking sit down and piss they're going to tell me i can't do that cause another bitch did it  scaff sb beezy stupid ass bitches yo niggas just want to compare her to somebody  nicki minaj everybody if they ever see me sitting down and peeing they're gonna fucking stone me  scaff sb beezy they're gonna say you're trying to be like barack's wife look at her she's sitting down and peeing like that you trying to be like michelle  nicki minaj why you sitting down and peeing nicki  scaff sb beezy why don't you stand up  charlemange that happens to everybody though  nicki minaj it does  scaff sb beezy no nicki gets it so hard  pause hospital flow need more gauze  charlamagne i think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable  nicki minaj absolutely i always say that for their minds to interpret it they have to draw a comparison and i always say even though it's very common it's just a more simpleminded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time it is what it is but even she gets compared to madonna and it's a neverending cycle but i rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to  charlamagne someone that is washed that's a natural emotion though it's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner that's just the way that it is  do you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say i did look like a damn fool  nicki minaj yes yes i do yes i do  charlemagne do you ever think that  scaff sb beezy sometimes every now and then you know what i like about superstars i like my superstars to be out there jump out the window be like prince with your ass out i may see it and say damn she looks like a fool but you're a superstar  that's how i want to see my superstars i don't want to see my superstars regular  _________________________________________________________________  nicki minaj i keep saying this i went to school for theater i took four years of my life and devoted it to theater  i did that because my passion was acting when i started rapping i felt like i couldn't really be myself when i started winning i started feeling that i can be myself i can do my accents i can do my voices i can do my faces i can do costumes  i can now bring me to who you know people see as nicki minaj i can now really bring me into it and i think that's where the confusion lies is that people thought that when i first came out that that was me in my entirety but that wasn't that was a small facet of who i was  but who you see now is just a more multifaceted mixture of all the personalities that i have in me i mean and i think that if i was to not show that then i wouldn't be doing justice to all the people that feel like i do cause for every person who doesn't understand it is there is a person who feels like me who feels like sometimes i just break out in an english accent you know like what's wrong with that  charlemagne you can why not  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne do you think that mixtape nicki and pop nicki can exist in the same space  nicki minaj they already are they're already existing together and they are both winning  charlemagne who do you feel that you lean towards more  nicki minaj i can't choose i can't pick i feel like the world makes them two different people but in my mind they're the same person  that's what i keep saying i grew up in new york my whole life i would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend and then monday through friday i was having a ninetofive on wall street  when i was an office manager i wasn't having the same conversation in the office that i was having on the block but i was still the same person i was onika but i knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people get a job ace the interview and then go home with my home girls and have fun  charlemagne it seems like you're very versatile if it's one thing that i would love for little girls to embrace from nicki minaj is the fact that she is versatile she knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting  nicki minaj right because you can't do too much of either you really can't  it's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side when that is detrimental for your future it's detrimental for your growth it's detrimental to your longevity  at a certain point as a woman  i'm not talking about as a man because we've seen the blueprint with jay we've seen that you could come in the game and do 0  5  still win and still be the king of hip hop we have not seen that with a woman so show me the blueprint that's all i want you to do  show me the blueprint  charlemagne i think you are creating it because queen latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore she went on to become an actress  nicki minaj and is someone who i tip my hat to because queen latifah looked at it and said okay wait hmm i may not want to be 40 years old rapping the hip hop fans may not want to hear me when i'm 40 years old rapping so i'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who i am can be seen queen latifah does musicals movies voiceovers for cartoons  is she a sellout or is she winning  charlemagne she's winning  nicki minaj so these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed and they're living in you know low income housing  is that winning just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap the same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way that downloaded the shit get the fuck out of here  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne when it's all said and done are you going to want to have kids get married  nicki minaj oh my goodness i have to i have to yep i'm gonna get married and have kids i love children i am obsessed with children  and yeah i believe in marriage and i believe marriage is forever so that's the other thing  scaff sb beezy look in my eyes look in my eyes  know that we'll always be forever  moment in time moment in time  nicki minaj safaree safaree  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne do you have any regrets cause you've had a relatively short career this is the second album and hopefully we can ten more of these but do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been nicki minaj  nicki minaj i think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when i could have  charlemange how can the author of i wish i could enjoy this moment for life not be here trying to enjoy every moment  nicki minaj absolutely and that's the thing it kinda just comes so quickly  scaff sb beezy pause  nicki minaj and then all of a sudden it's like wait a minute i just did super bowl i just did super bowl with madonna and before i go into the super bowl stage i'm just stressing and worrying and then when i come off it's all done and what i did i even enjoy about it  charlemagne not even that you closed up the grammy's  scaff sb beezy but that's why cause she's doing the super bowl and she's thinking about the grammy's  nicki minaj and then i'm doing the grammy's and i'm thinking about the nba allstar game that's the only thing  i've gotten to a very good place though all of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled i used to be and every time i tell people no no i'm really good i'm really happy i'm really at a peaceful place it's almost like they don't believe me so i thought the other day i must have really really been worried a lot because people who know me very well are like are you sure you're ok but i really am i've never been this happy i'm so proud of this album i'm proud of myself and i will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential it's a scare tactic _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne what is nicki minaj's purpose because from the outside looking in i think you're a very blessed individual because you got two things going against you number one you're a female and the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping and then you're from new york there's a lot of rappers from new york that aren't popping right now so you got those two things going against you  being that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are it's like she's obviously here for something i think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know but what is nicki minaj's purpose  nicki minaj i have to pray on that i think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans really i've always had this dream of having a nicki minaj ymca type of thing when i was young  well everybody knows my story  we didn't have a lot free lunch was the thing we can get free lunch oh we're going to free lunch this is like dope so i remember those moments and i always play them back in my head and i wish to think to myself i wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that  but things were moving so quickly my parents were so not really stable and just  my father being an addict and all that in a lot of ways i feel like i didn't really have a childhood so when i see kids it melts my heart because i'm looking at them and i'm like they'll never get this moment back again and they'll always remember this time how do we as adults optimize it for them right now whether they have money or not  i think that one day i would like to do something for them for kids in the inner cities for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling tutoring i remember i was really really smart in school and i think my mother took that for granted so she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push but i think that kids need that  it's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education but that's real shit i don't just say that because it sounds good i really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college  i feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain i don't feel like that ever happened most of my closest girlfriends it was just like once they got out of high school they figured oh well we're good now we're out of high school or i got my ged i'm good and i don't want my fans to think like that  i have such a great rapport with my fans when they see me they really be bringing out their bachelor's and their master's saying look nicki look because they know how important it is to me it's ok to have fun i'mma give you the raunchiest sometimes but i also want you to realize that it's for a time  one day you're going to look back and think wait a minute did i really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where i could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children  we got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child but you're having a child because i want to keep this dude or it just happened i want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that we're the ones in control again why are we never in control  why are we stuck with a baby why are we always stuck on the welfare line why are we always stuck having to beg borrow and steal to provide for our children why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby waiting until you're 5 or 6 to have children  technology has changed  you can wait have something to offer them that's something that's dear to my heart doing something that makes children feel like i don't have to rush to grow up i can enjoy my childhood i can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes that's my bigger goal in life  charlemagne how do you stay humble i know you keep a tight circle you keep guys like scaff beezy around  i'm gonna ask scaff how do you keep her humble scaff beezy do you ever see her getting a little bit extra  scaff sb beezy you wanna know what's crazy yesterday remember i was saying to you it's so crazy she's so famous if she goes out anytime we go somewhere it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie  the other day we went to a carnival we thought we'd be able to be in there and just go on some rides and nobody will notice anything within like seven minutes the whole park  it was 0 5 minutes until we got out  she really hasn't changed she really don't act like i'm this person or i'm that person she just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that it doesn't faze her she really hasn't changed a bit  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne pay attention to that how did you escape being more than just an ass  nicki minaj we said that the other day before i was just a rapping butt  safaree sb samuels a butt with lyrics  charlemagne how did you get out of that  nicki minaj because i created a brand  people take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won it's very hard mentally this shit is draining and draining for you to be able to get up there and do music that people love and do interviews with a smile on your face and act like this shit ain't getting to you it's draining  it's crazy that's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics when i was coming up i never understood it i use to be like what they are so ungrateful why are they on drugs why don't they fucking appreciate their success i would kill to be where they are until you get here and you are like oh my god lord is this the price i have to pay if i really want this and he's like yep now let's see who really want it but i think i became more than that because people cannot deny at the end of the day people can't deny that  charlamagne you the shit say it you don't have to be humble be like ray j i'm tired of being humble  nicki minaj i'm not a cocky person by nature  charlemagne scaff be cocky for her  scaff sb beezy yeah yeah yeah man you bitches ain't shit man you need to just really  when you see her get the rose petals just like she's said before throw it out in front of her feet you pour out the champagne you feed her grapes if something needs to be sucked you suck it  nicki minaj what what would need to be sucked on you  scaff sb beezy ay anything anywhere i'm in these streets looking for work we're all in these streets we're looking for that work that twerk  _________________________________________________________________  charlemagne i just want to tell you nicki i think that you're very necessary i think you represent something way bigger than hip hop i think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels and i think like how jayz took it to heights and made people be like damn hip hop can take you this far i think you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further so keep doing your thing ma  nicki minaj thank you darling
